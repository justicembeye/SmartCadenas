    General notes on the underlying Mersenne Twister core generator:

    * The period is 2**19937-1.
    * It is one of the most extensively tested generators in existence.
    * The random() method is implemented in C, executes in a single Python step,
      and is, therefore, threadsafe.

    class RRaannddoomm(_random.Random)
     |  Random(x=None)
     |
     |  Random number generator base class used by bound module functions.
     |
     |  Used to instantiate instances of Random to get generators that don't
     |  share state.
     |
     |  Class Random can also be subclassed if you want to use a different basic
     |  generator of your own devising: in that case, override the following
     |  methods:  random(), seed(), getstate(), and setstate().
     |  Optionally, implement a getrandbits() method so that randrange()
     |  can cover arbitrarily large ranges.

     |      Conditions on the parameters are alpha > 0 and beta > 0.
     |      Returned values range between 0 and 1.
     |
     |      The mean (expected value) and variance of the random variable are:
     |
     |          E[X] = alpha / (alpha + beta)
     |          Var[X] = alpha * beta / ((alpha + beta)**2 * (alpha + beta + 1))
     |
     |  bbiinnoommiiaallvvaarriiaattee(self, n=1, p=0.5)
     |      Binomial random variable.
     |
     |      Gives the number of successes for *n* independent trials
     |      with the probability of success in each trial being *p*:
     |
     |          sum(random() < p for i in range(n))
     |
     |      Returns an integer in the range:   0 <= X <= n
     |
     |      The mean (expected value) and variance of the random variable are:
     |
     |          E[X] = n * p
     |          Var[x] = n * p * (1 - p)
     |
     |  cchhooiiccee(self, seq)
     |      Choose a random element from a non-empty sequence.
     |
     |  cchhooiicceess(self, population, weights=None, *, cum_weights=None, k=1)
     |      Return a k sized list of population elements chosen with replacement.
     |
     |      If the relative weights or cumulative weights are not specified,
     |      the selections are made with equal probability.
     |
     |  eexxppoovvaarriiaattee(self, lambd=1.0)
     |      Exponential distribution.
     |
     |      lambd is 1.0 divided by the desired mean.  It should be
     |      nonzero.  (The parameter would be called "lambda", but that is
     |      a reserved word in Python.)  Returned values range from 0 to
     |      positive infinity if lambd is positive, and from negative
     |      infinity to 0 if lambd is negative.
     |
     |      The mean (expected value) and variance of the random variable are:
     |
     |          E[X] = 1 / lambd
     |          Var[X] = 1 / lambd ** 2
     |
     |  ggaammmmaavvaarriiaattee(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Gamma distribution.  Not the gamma function!
     |
     |      Conditions on the parameters are alpha > 0 and beta > 0.
     |
     |      The probability distribution function is:
     |
     |                  x ** (alpha - 1) * math.exp(-x / beta)
     |        pdf(x) =  --------------------------------------
     |                    math.gamma(alpha) * beta ** alpha
     |
     |      The mean (expected value) and variance of the random variable are:
     |
     |          E[X] = alpha * beta
     |          Var[X] = alpha * beta ** 2
     |
     |  ggaauussss(self, mu=0.0, sigma=1.0)
     |      Gaussian distribution.
     |
     |      mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.  This is
     |      slightly faster than the normalvariate() function.
     |
     |      Not thread-safe without a lock around calls.
     |
     |  ggeettssttaattee(self)
     |      Return internal state; can be passed to setstate() later.
     |
     |  llooggnnoorrmmvvaarriiaattee(self, mu, sigma)
     |      Log normal distribution.
     |
     |      If you take the natural logarithm of this distribution, you'll get a
     |      normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation sigma.
     |      mu can have any value, and sigma must be greater than zero.
     |
     |  nnoorrmmaallvvaarriiaattee(self, mu=0.0, sigma=1.0)
     |      Normal distribution.
     |
     |      mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.
     |
     |  ppaarreettoovvaarriiaattee(self, alpha)
     |      Pareto distribution.  alpha is the shape parameter.
     |
     |  rraannddbbyytteess(self, n)
     |      Generate n random bytes.
     |
     |  rraannddiinntt(self, a, b)
     |      Return random integer in range [a, b], including both end points.
     |
     |  rraannddrraannggee(self, start, stop=None, step=1)
     |      Choose a random item from range(stop) or range(start, stop[, step]).
     |
     |      Roughly equivalent to ``choice(range(start, stop, step))`` but
     |      supports arbitrarily large ranges and is optimized for common cases.
     |
     |  ssaammppllee(self, population, k, *, counts=None)
     |      Chooses k unique random elements from a population sequence.
     |
     |      Returns a new list containing elements from the population while
     |      leaving the original population unchanged.  The resulting list is
     |      in selection order so that all sub-slices will also be valid random
     |      samples.  This allows raffle winners (the sample) to be partitioned
     |      into grand prize and second place winners (the subslices).
     |
     |      Members of the population need not be hashable or unique.  If the
     |      population contains repeats, then each occurrence is a possible
     |      selection in the sample.
     |
     |      Repeated elements can be specified one at a time or with the optional
     |      counts parameter.  For example:
     |
     |          sample(['red', 'blue'], counts=[4, 2], k=5)
     |
     |      is equivalent to:
     |
     |          sample(['red', 'red', 'red', 'red', 'blue', 'blue'], k=5)
     |
     |      To choose a sample from a range of integers, use range() for the
     |      population argument.  This is especially fast and space efficient
     |      for sampling from a large population:
     |
     |          sample(range(10000000), 60)
     |
     |  sseeeedd(self, a=None, version=2)
     |      Initialize internal state from a seed.
     |
     |      The only supported seed types are None, int, float,
     |      str, bytes, and bytearray.
     |
     |      None or no argument seeds from current time or from an operating
     |      system specific randomness source if available.
     |
     |      If *a* is an int, all bits are used.
     |
     |      For version 2 (the default), all of the bits are used if *a* is a str,
     |      bytes, or bytearray.  For version 1 (provided for reproducing random
     |      sequences from older versions of Python), the algorithm for str and
     |      bytes generates a narrower range of seeds.
     |
     |  sseettssttaattee(self, state)
     |      Restore internal state from object returned by getstate().
     |
     |  sshhuuffffllee(self, x)
     |      Shuffle list x in place, and return None.
     |
     |  ttrriiaanngguullaarr(self, low=0.0, high=1.0, mode=None)
     |      Triangular distribution.
     |
     |      Continuous distribution bounded by given lower and upper limits,
     |      and having a given mode value in-between.
     |
     |      http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Triangular_distribution
     |
     |      The mean (expected value) and variance of the random variable are:
     |
     |          E[X] = (low + high + mode) / 3
     |          Var[X] = (low**2 + high**2 + mode**2 - low*high - low*mode - high*mode) / 18
     |
     |  uunniiffoorrmm(self, a, b)
     |      Get a random number in the range [a, b) or [a, b] depending on rounding.
     |
     |      The mean (expected value) and variance of the random variable are:
     |
     |          E[X] = (a + b) / 2
     |          Var[X] = (b - a) ** 2 / 12
     |
     |  vvoonnmmiisseessvvaarriiaattee(self, mu, kappa)
     |      Circular data distribution.
     |
     |      mu is the mean angle, expressed in radians between 0 and 2*pi, and
     |      kappa is the concentration parameter, which must be greater than or
     |      equal to zero.  If kappa is equal to zero, this distribution reduces
     |      to a uniform random angle over the range 0 to 2*pi.
     |
     |  wweeiibbuullllvvaarriiaattee(self, alpha, beta)
     |      Weibull distribution.
     |
     |      alpha is the scale parameter and beta is the shape parameter.

     |      If you take the natural logarithm of this distribution, you'll get a

     |      Choose a random item from range(stop) or range(start, stop[, step]).
     |
     |      Roughly equivalent to ``choice(range(start, stop, step))`` but

     |
     |  ssaammppllee(self, population, k, *, counts=None)
     |      Chooses k unique random elements from a population sequence.
     |
     |      Returns a new list containing elements from the population while
     |      leaving the original population unchanged.  The resulting list is
     |      in selection order so that all sub-slices will also be valid random
     |      samples.  This allows raffle winners (the sample) to be partitioned
     |      into grand prize and second place winners (the subslices).
     |
     |      Members of the population need not be hashable or unique.  If the
     |      population contains repeats, then each occurrence is a possible
     |      selection in the sample.
     |
     |      Repeated elements can be specified one at a time or with the optional
     |      counts parameter.  For example:
     |
     |          sample(['red', 'blue'], counts=[4, 2], k=5)
     |
     |      is equivalent to:

     |      To choose a sample from a range of integers, use range() for the
     |      population argument.  This is especially fast and space efficient
     |      for sampling from a large population:

        Beta distribution.

        Conditions on the parameters are alpha > 0 and beta > 0.
        Returned values range between 0 and 1.

        The mean (expected value) and variance of the random variable are:

            E[X] = alpha / (alpha + beta)
            Var[X] = alpha * beta / ((alpha + beta)**2 * (alpha + beta + 1))

        Binomial random variable.

        Gives the number of successes for *n* independent trials
        with the probability of success in each trial being *p*:

            sum(random() < p for i in range(n))

        Returns an integer in the range:   0 <= X <= n

        The mean (expected value) and variance of the random variable are:

            E[X] = n * p
            Var[x] = n * p * (1 - p)

    cchhooiiccee(seq) method of Random instance
        Choose a random element from a non-empty sequence.

    cchhooiicceess(population, weights=None, *, cum_weights=None, k=1) method of Random instance
        Return a k sized list of population elements chosen with replacement.

        If the relative weights or cumulative weights are not specified,

    eexxppoovvaarriiaattee(lambd=1.0) method of Random instance
        Exponential distribution.

        lambd is 1.0 divided by the desired mean.  It should be
        nonzero.  (The parameter would be called "lambda", but that is
        a reserved word in Python.)  Returned values range from 0 to
        positive infinity if lambd is positive, and from negative
        infinity to 0 if lambd is negative.

        The mean (expected value) and variance of the random variable are:

            E[X] = 1 / lambd
            Var[X] = 1 / lambd ** 2

        Gamma distribution.  Not the gamma function!

        Conditions on the parameters are alpha > 0 and beta > 0.

        The probability distribution function is:

                    x ** (alpha - 1) * math.exp(-x / beta)
          pdf(x) =  --------------------------------------
                      math.gamma(alpha) * beta ** alpha

        The mean (expected value) and variance of the random variable are:

            E[X] = alpha * beta

    ggaauussss(mu=0.0, sigma=1.0) method of Random instance
        Gaussian distribution.

        mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.  This is
        slightly faster than the normalvariate() function.

        Not thread-safe without a lock around calls.

    ggeettrraannddbbiittss(k, /) method of Random instance
        getrandbits(k) -> x.  Generates an int with k random bits.

    ggeettssttaattee() method of Random instance
        Return internal state; can be passed to setstate() later.

    llooggnnoorrmmvvaarriiaattee(mu, sigma) method of Random instance
        Log normal distribution.

        If you take the natural logarithm of this distribution, you'll get a
        normal distribution with mean mu and standard deviation sigma.
        mu can have any value, and sigma must be greater than zero.

        mu is the mean, and sigma is the standard deviation.

    ppaarreettoovvaarriiaattee(alpha) method of Random instance
        Pareto distribution.  alpha is the shape parameter.

    rraannddbbyytteess(n) method of Random instance
        Generate n random bytes.

    rraannddiinntt(a, b) method of Random instance
        Return random integer in range [a, b], including both end points.

    rraannddoomm() method of Random instance
        random() -> x in the interval [0, 1).

    rraannddrraannggee(start, stop=None, step=1) method of Random instance
        Choose a random item from range(stop) or range(start, stop[, step]).

        Roughly equivalent to ``choice(range(start, stop, step))`` but
        supports arbitrarily large ranges and is optimized for common cases.

    ssaammppllee(population, k, *, counts=None) method of Random instance
        Chooses k unique random elements from a population sequence.

        Returns a new list containing elements from the population while
        leaving the original population unchanged.  The resulting list is
        in selection order so that all sub-slices will also be valid random
        samples.  This allows raffle winners (the sample) to be partitioned
        into grand prize and second place winners (the subslices).

        Members of the population need not be hashable or unique.  If the
        population contains repeats, then each occurrence is a possible
        selection in the sample.

        Repeated elements can be specified one at a time or with the optional
        counts parameter.  For example:

            sample(['red', 'blue'], counts=[4, 2], k=5)

        is equivalent to:

            sample(['red', 'red', 'red', 'red', 'blue', 'blue'], k=5)

        To choose a sample from a range of integers, use range() for the
        population argument.  This is especially fast and space efficient
        for sampling from a large population:

            sample(range(10000000), 60)

    sseeeedd(a=None, version=2) method of Random instance
        Initialize internal state from a seed.

        The only supported seed types are None, int, float,
        str, bytes, and bytearray.

        None or no argument seeds from current time or from an operating
        system specific randomness source if available.

        If *a* is an int, all bits are used.

        For version 2 (the default), all of the bits are used if *a* is a str,
        bytes, or bytearray.  For version 1 (provided for reproducing random
        sequences from older versions of Python), the algorithm for str and
        bytes generates a narrower range of seeds.

    sseettssttaattee(state) method of Random instance
        Restore internal state from object returned by getstate().

    sshhuuffffllee(x) method of Random instance

        The mean (expected value) and variance of the random variable are:

            E[X] = (low + high + mode) / 3
            Var[X] = (low**2 + high**2 + mode**2 - low*high - low*mode - high*mode) / 18

    uunniiffoorrmm(a, b) method of Random instance
        Get a random number in the range [a, b) or [a, b] depending on rounding.

        The mean (expected value) and variance of the random variable are:

            Var[X] = (b - a) ** 2 / 12

    vvoonnmmiisseessvvaarriiaattee(mu, kappa) method of Random instance

        mu is the mean angle, expressed in radians between 0 and 2*pi, and
